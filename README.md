# Ractive HTML loader

Based on [webpack-html-loader](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/html-loader).
This loader handles HTML file includeding external resources and generates [Ractive](https://github.com/ractivejs/ractive) object template using [Ractive.parse](https://ractive.js.org/api/#ractiveparse).
